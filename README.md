here I tried to use semaphopres and mutex to handle jobs between consumer and producer.

at first n would be given to your code that is the number of consumers and the n following lines are their order with either 1 or 2,that means 1 is the sandwich that the first chef makes and so on.

and the output lines will show the number of ingredients they needed.
